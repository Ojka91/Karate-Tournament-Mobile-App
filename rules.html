                                    <p>At the beginning of the division all competitors will sit on Aka side of ring.
                                        • All competitors will remain seated in a prescribed order.
                                        • The order of seating may be altered by the Referee to avoid competitors from the same district
                                        competing against each other in the first round only.
                                        • The first two competitors will bow before entering the match area and the next two competitors
                                        will stand up and be on deck.
                                        • Both competitors shall enter the match area and space themselves so as to avoid collision or
                                        interference in the performance of their Kata.
                                        • The competitors will bow and announce their Kata. They shall commence their performance at the
                                        sound of the whistle by the Referee.
                                        • On completion of their Kata, the competitors shall stand side-by-side in the match area and await
                                        the decision from the Panel.
                                        • If the Kata does not conform to the rules, or there is some other irregularity, the Referee may call
                                        the other Judges in order to reach a verdict.
                                        • After completion of both Kata, the Referee shall call for a decision (HANTEI) and blow a two-tone
                                        blast on the whistle. The flags shall be raised at the same time.
                                        • The Referee shall blow a further short blast on the whistle, whereupon the flags shall be lowered.
                                        • The decision shall be for Aka or Shiro. No ties are permitted. The competitor who receives the
                                        majority of votes shall be declared the winner.
                                        • The Referee will then raise the flag for the winner.
                                        • The competitors will then bow to the judging panel and exit the match area.
                                        • The winner will go to the end of the line on the Aka side.
                                        • The defeated competitor will form a line on the Shiro side furthest from the Referee panel.
                                        • The next two competitors will perform their kata in the same manner and will sit behind the
                                        previous competitor in the appropriate line (Winner to Aka side and defeated competitor to Shiro
                                        side).
                                        • The procedure outlined above, will continue until there is only one competitor remaining in the first
                                        round line, who will be the gold medalist.
                                        • The last two competitors remaining will be allowed a one-minute rest period, before beginning the
                                        final match.
                                        • The gold medalist and the last competitor of the first round will sit on the Shiro side of the Referee
                                        panel and be exempt from the second round of elimination. The gold medalist will sit closest to the
                                        Referee panel. </p>

                                    <p>Competitors are placed into categories according to their weight and maybe their age in the case of junior competitions. All competitors in Karate kumite competitions are required to wear a traditional Karate suit known as a gi and this should be plain and without stripes or embroidery. Instead of wearing the belt colour that signifies their rank, one contestant wears a red belt and the other a blue belt to help distinguish them. Other prescribed pieces of equipment are:

                                        A gum shield
                                        Body protection (and extra chest protection for females)
                                        Shin pads
                                        Foot protectors
                                        Groin guards can be worn but are not mandatory.</p>

                                    <p> Scoring is limited to the following areas of the opponent's body:

                                        Head
                                        Face
                                        Neck
                                        Chest
                                        Abdomen

                                        Back
                                        A score is awarded when one fighter performs a technique that conforms to the following criteria and the blow lands on a relevant scoring area of their opponent’s body:

                                        Good form
                                        Vigorous application

                                        Sporting attitude
                                        Fighters can score one, two or three points for attacking techniques:

                                        Ippon (three points) is awarded for:

                                        A jodan kick (kick to upper level)
                                        Any scoring technique performed on a fallen or thrown opponent
